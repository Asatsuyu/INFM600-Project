##Setup the variables for storing the average number of pesticides per sample and average residue concentration in preparation for storing the results from the 'for' loops below.

##Create subsets of pesticide data by variety via matching variety names from the frequency list previous created (stored as rownames) with Samples_2014_Regular$VARIETY, getting a list of primary key values for samples of those varieties, then match those primary key values to Results_2014_Regular_Detected$SAMPLE_PK so the corresponding pesticide codes and concentrations can be pulled from the test results of detected residues for 2014.
