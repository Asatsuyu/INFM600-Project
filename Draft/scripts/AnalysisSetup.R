##This script calls the Data_Cleaning.R script to import the data for this project and do initial data setup, then make preparations for analysis by creating subsets of the data with various conditions.
##To be merged with other analysis scripts near ending of the scripting phase.

#Set working directory to the directory of this R script, which also contains all the required csv data files and all other R scripts for this project (placed inside "if" condition in case this script is called from another R script where the working directory had already been set).
if (!exists("wd")) {

#Note of things to include/add:
#Total Statistics, pesticides for 2014, 2004
#Total Statistics, concentrations for 2014, 2004
#number of pesticides per sample, conv vs org
#sd of CONCEN?
#range of CONCEN (min and max) - partof summary
#quantile of CONCEN - partof summary
#average of how many pesticides are tested per sample?
